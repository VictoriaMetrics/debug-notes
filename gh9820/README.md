Test legacy streaming insert protocol and RPC block one. For that spin up a cluster with two inserts and two storages. 
Where one insert uses legacy streaming protocol and the other one uses RPC block one protocol. 
Where one storage support only legacy streaming protocol and the other supports both protocols. 

Run `./setup.sh` to get binaries than spin up each using `run-xxx.sh` in separate terminal window. 

Play with the cluster).
