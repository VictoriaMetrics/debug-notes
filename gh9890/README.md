- To test different scenarios change in `docker-compose.yml`:
- implementation of slowness algo in `vmstorage-1.image`.
- introduce a bottleneck by adjusting available cpu in `vmstorage-1.cpus`.

The load could be generated by script:

```
# moderate load
go run client.go 25

# overload
go run client.go 80
```

The metrics are collected by `vmagent` and send to my `homelab` Victoriametrics instance. 
Feel free to change it to your own VM storage\Grafana setup.
