# Operator quick starts

The commands I used while working on [Operator Quick Start]()https://docs.victoriametrics.com/operator/quick-start. 

They are sorted in the order they were used and split by sections 

0x - operator
1x - storage
2x,3x - scrapping
4x - alerting

The only pre requeste is to have a working kubernetes cluster:
```
kind create cluster --name quick-start
```
